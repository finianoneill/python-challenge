# Python Challenge

The repository contains a practice problem of building polling and banking software using Python. This entire application was built solely in Python.

## Getting Started

The files within the PyPoll and PyBank folders simply can be run from the command line using an installed version of Python.

## Results

The Python 'main.py' file within the PyBank folder calculates a number of financial metrics based on the data contained within the Resources folder.

The Python 'main.py' file within the PyPoll folder calculates voting results for the dataset contained within the Resources folder of PyPoll.
